## 🧰 From Raw Data to Actionable Insights: The Technology Stack

### 1. Interactive Front-End (**Streamlit**)
The intuitive user interface is crafted with **Streamlit**, a powerful Python library for creating dynamic, data-driven web applications. This allows for a seamless and interactive user experience, making complex data accessible to a non-technical audience.

### 2. Robust Back-End (**Python & Machine Learning**)
The application's core is a sophisticated back-end that handles everything from data ingestion to predictive modeling:

- **Data Manipulation & Analysis**: Using **Pandas** and **NumPy** for efficient data loading, cleaning, and transformation.
- **Statistical Insights**: The "Statistical Analysis" tab utilizes **SciPy**, **Statsmodels**, and **Seaborn** for in-depth exploration, uncovering patterns and correlations.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Built using **Scikit-learn**, these models are trained to detect anomalies in sensor data that signal impending equipment failure.
