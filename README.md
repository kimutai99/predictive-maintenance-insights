## 📌 Overview  
This application demonstrates how machine learning can transform industrial maintenance from reactive to predictive. By analyzing equipment sensor data, it identifies failure patterns before they occur, enabling:  

✔ **Cost Reduction** – Minimize unplanned downtime and emergency repairs  
✔ **Safety Improvement** – Proactively address equipment risks  
✔ **Resource Optimization** – Schedule maintenance based on data-driven insights
